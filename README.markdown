# Grid Gallery

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/RGonyeau/pen/QNLrBP](https://codepen.io/RGonyeau/pen/QNLrBP).

This is a simple 8-Up image gallery. It uses the bootstrap grid framework to keep everything symmetrical, regardless of media query. Clicking on an image will initiate full width, and display a title and description. Classes have been included to move the description (top-right, bottom-left, etc.) so that the user can appropriately place it depending on the image content.
